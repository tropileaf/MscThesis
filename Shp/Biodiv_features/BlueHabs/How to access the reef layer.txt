How to access the reef layer
----------------------------

The reef layer is not distributed in this zip file.

The Reefs data layers were developed by the World Resource Institute as part of the Reefs at Risk Revisited project (2011).
The reef shapefiles can be downloaded as part of the base data (GIS Data Sets -> Base Data) from the Reefs at Risk page on the World Resource Institute wesite
